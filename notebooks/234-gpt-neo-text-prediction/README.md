# GPT-Neo Text Prediction with OpenVINO
Text generation is a type of natural language processing that uses computational linguistics and artificial intelligence to automatically produce text that can meet specific communicative needs.
In this demo we use the **Generative Pre-trained Transformer Neo ([GPT-Neo](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neo))** model for text prediction.

The complete pipeline of this demo's notebook is shown below.

This is a demonstration in which the user can type the beginning of the text and the network will generate a further. This procedure can be repeated as many times as the user desires.

The following image show an example of the input sequence and corresponding predicted sequence.
