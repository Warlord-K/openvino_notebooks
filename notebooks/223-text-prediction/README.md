# Text Prediction with OpenVINO
Text generation is a type of natural language processing that uses computational linguistics and artificial intelligence to automatically produce text that can meet specific communicative needs.


In this demo we have the models:

* **Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 ([GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/model_card.md))** model for text prediction.
* **Generative Pre-trained Transformer Neo ([GPT-Neo](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neo))** model for text prediction.
* **PersonaGPT ([PersonaGPT](https://huggingface.co/af1tang/personaGPT))** model for Conversation
The complete pipeline of this Text Generation is shown below.

This is a demonstration in which the user can type the beginning of the text and the network will generate a further. This procedure can be repeated as many times as the user desires.

The following images show an example of the input sequence and corresponding predicted sequence.

This is a demonstration in which a user can have a conversation with the model. The User provides some input based upon which the model generates a response,the user can further talk to the model as if having chat with the model.

The following image shows and example of a conversation.
